# Html Chapter 1: Structure

- Html pages are text documents that are like the frame of a house.  
- Html uses tags which give the info they surround special meaning.  
- Tags are referred to as elements.  
- Tags usually come in pairs with an opening and ending.  
- Opening tags can carry attributes which tell more about the content of that element.  
- Attributes need a name and a value.  

# Html Chapter 8: Extra Markup

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of html you are using.  
- You can add comments to your code by typing: "<!-- comments go here -->".
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify specific elements.
- The <div> and <span> allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> make windows in your webpages that show other web pages like a working google maps window.
- <meta> tag is where you store all kinds of info about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to add special characters to your pages like: <, >, copy right logo, etc.

# Html Chapter 17: Html5 Layout

- Html5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help describe it's structure.
- Html5 provides clearer code and you don't have to use as many <div> elements.
- Older browsers need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- Older browsers may need extra javascript.

# Html Chapter 18: Process & Design

- It's important to know who your target audience is and why they would visit your website.  You also need to know what info they want to find and when they will return.
- Site maps let you plan the structure of your website.
- Wireframes allow you to organize where the info will go on your website like a header, nav bar, main, footer, etc.
- Visual hierarchy helps people understand what you are trying to communicate on your website.
- You can differentiate different things on your website by using size, color, and style.
- Grouping and Similarity help simplify the info on your website.

# JavaScript Introduction

The JavaScript & Jquery interactive front-end web development book is broken down into 6 main components:

- Introduction
- Reference
- Background
- Diagram
- Example
- Summary

The structure of the book is divided into 2 sections:
- Core concepts
- Practical applications

The main components are:
- How javascript makes web pages more interactive.
- Examples of javascript in the browser.

# JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming
- A: What is a script? B: How do computers fit in with the world around them? C: How do I write a script for a web page?

- A script is a series of instructions the computer follows to achieve a goal.
- Each time a script runs it might only use part of all the instructions given.
- Your instructions must let the computer solve tasks programmatically.  
- When writing a script, break down your gola into a series of taks then work out each step as needed to complete that task.
- Computers create models of the world using data.
- The models use objects to represent physical things.  Objects can have properties that tell us about the object, methods that perform taks using the properties of that object, events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
- Programmers can write code to say "whenever this event occurs, run that code."
- Web browsers use html markup to create a model of the web page.  Each element creates it's own node.
- To make web pages interactive  you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
- Its best to keep javascript code in it's own file.  javascript files are text files but have the ".js" extension.
- The html "<script>" element is used to tell the browser to load the javascript file similar to the <link> element used to load a CSS file.
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser the javascript will not have changed the html because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
