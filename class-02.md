# Chapter 10: Introducing CSS Summary

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside it's own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

- Delarations are made up of 2 parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document but they may appear within an HTML page.

- <link> Used in an html document to tell the browser where to find the css file used to style the page.

- href Used to specify the path to the CSS file.

- type Used to specify the type of document being linked to.

- rel Used to specofy the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.  

- <style> Used for inline styling with html instead of a more commonly used external style sheet.

- Universal Selector: * Applies to all elements in the document.

- Type Selector: Matches element names

- Class Selector: . Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period.

- ID Selector: # Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol.

- Child Selector: Matches an element that is a direct child of another.

- Descendant Selector: Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element.

- Adjacent Sibling Selector: Matches an element that is the next sibling of another.

- General Sibling: Matches an element that is a sibling of another.

# Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9) strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

- Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

- Comparison operators are used to compare 2 operands.

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

- If...else staements allow you to runone set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

- Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes.
