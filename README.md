A growth mindset is the belief you can grow and enhance your abilities through perseverance and effort.  Basically if you embrace challenges, don't let obstacles get in your way, continue to try over and over again, learn from criticism, and be inspired by the success of others instead of being jealous, you will be very successful!  

### Reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

1. Stay **positive** and give it *your all*
2. Embrace **Challenges** and push through *obstacles* in your way
3. Learn from **critism** and be inspired by the *success of others*
