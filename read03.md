# Git Intro

Git is a type of version control system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.  Specifically Git is a Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) which means it isn't as vulnerable as a CVS which can go down and then developers are unable to work together.  

## How Git Works

Essentially with Git you are greating a repository or file you are working on and Git allows you to go through various stages of editing these repositories either by yourself of collaborating with others.  

The Git Local Repository Structure has three components: 

1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2. Index: The area used for staging
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit
