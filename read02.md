It seems to be largely preference when it comes to picking a text editor or IDE.  The simple answer seems to depend on what you use most.  Some key features to look for however are:

1. code completion
2. syntax highligting
3. good variety of themes
4. good variety of extensions

It's important for a software developer to pick a text editor that suits them as this is a huge tool they use every day for their work.  A good text editor/IDE can have several components to them working together like html, css, javascipt, debugger, etc. and its important to pick one that has the tools that work for you.
