# Summarizing Markdown

Markdown is a cool way of writing basic text that gets coverted into a website.
It makes it so you don't have to write out full html code because it does it for you!

I love how **cool** and *easy* it is to make things **bold** and *italic*

You can also do neat things like add ordered and unordered lists!
