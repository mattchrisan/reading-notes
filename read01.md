# Summarizing Markdown

Markdown is a cool way of writing basic text that gets coverted into a website.
It makes it so you don't have to write out full html code because it does it for you!

I love how **cool** and *easy* it is to make things **bold** and *italic*

You can also do neat things like add ordered and unordered lists!

## Grocery List

1. Apples
2. Bread
3. Cookies
4. Soap

## Things To Get Done

- Mow Lawn
- Pay Bills
- Update Computer

You can even link your favorite websites easily like [this] (https://www.codefellows.org)

If you want to add media like pictures, no problem!  Markdown is there for you!
