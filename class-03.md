# HTML & CSS Chapter 3: Lists

* There are 3 main types of HTML lists:
1. Ordered List - which use numbers.
2. Unordered List - which use bullets.
3. Definition List - which are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# HTML & CSS Chapter 13: Boxes

* CSS basically makes everything into a box.  It turns each element into i's own box.
* CSS controls the dimensions of a box.
* You can control the borders, margins, and padding for each box.  Basically control how the box moves around on a web page.
* You can hide elements using display and visibility properties.
* There are differnet box types such as **Block**, **Inline**, and **Inline Block**.  These can be changed into each other from however each one was created.
* You can makes things more legible by controlling the width of the boxes.
*You can create image borders and rounded borders.

# JavaScript Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

* Arrays - a special type of variable that doesn't just store 1 value, it stores a lit of values.  
* Consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.
* Espcially helpful when you do not know how many times a list will contain because when you create the array you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.
* You create an array just like any other variable by using the **var** key word followed by the name of the array.
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list.  It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at 0 not 1.

# JavaScript Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

* if...else statements - allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements - allow you to compare a value agaisnt possible outcomes and also provides a default option if none match.
* Data types - can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are 3 types of loop: **for**, **while**, and **do...while**.  Each repeats a set of staements.
