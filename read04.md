# Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is a practice which allows you to map out the design and hierarchy of a website you are designing.  You can hand draw the layout you want or use digital sketching tools.  You also want to think about the different platforms you are designing said page for such as a normal computer versus a mobile phone etc.  There are several different ways to start that look like this: Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code.  Another trick is to draft, don’t draw and sketch, don’t illustrate.

# Mozilla HTML Basics

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.  

The main parts of an element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends.  
3. The content: This is the content of the element.
The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
